<h1>
    Hi, my name is Lu Vazquez
</h1>
<hr>
<h2>
    This is my developer story. 
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
     <li>Growing up, my family was fortunate enough to have a 90s personal computer with a brick like tower and a cube style monitor.  The downside, however, was we did not have an internet connection.</li> 
     <li>I remember playing around with the paint application - that is where my fascination with computers and technology began, and also, where my love for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pato.paint/">digital art</a> came to fruition. </li>  
     <li>As I got older, I realized I was somewhat tech savvy and really began to enjoy using computers. However, It never really went beyond the typical personal usage.</li>
     <li>After high-school, I thought I wanted to pursue something in the medical field, but I quickly learned I was not entirely passionate about that field.</li>
     <li>My first job at a call center, led me into my first job in tech.</li>
     <li>After some experience with working with code, I fell in love with tech. But trying to learn on my own has been overwhelming to the point where I didn’t know where to start. </li>
     <li>I aplied and got accepted into Refcode, and I’m excited for this opportunity to grow and learn!</li>
    </ul>
